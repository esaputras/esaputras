# Hi, I’m Esa Putra Saktiawan<br />

I'm currently live in Jakarta, Indonesia<br />
I've got my Baachelor Degree from Universitas Negeri Jakarta in Indonesia<br />

I’m interested in data analysis and data science and my latest project for my essay is about performance test of real time side face recognition using OpenCV

I’m currently learning about data analysis fundamentals and going to move to learn more to data science afterwards
